# RDO

Current project is test which intended to rate speed of response user on moving object. Main test iteration: sphere 
right-handed with concrete speed, user must stop sphere, when it belong to control point. Speed of response user 
on moving object rated as time distance between sphere and control point. Also sphere rotation speed changed conditionally rate 
speed of response user in last test iteration thought [Fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic)
